# CEC-2024-Programming-Competition

Welcome to the team Tunnel's README.md. Everything you need is in this [Github repository](https://github.com/Spiratatoe/CEC-2024-Programming-Competition).

## To run Pygame
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) Version: 3.9.13 
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) Version: 2.5.2

To run Pygame, go in the [interface](https://github.com/Spiratatoe/CEC-2024-Programming-Competition/tree/main/interface) folder, run the [pygame_cec.py](https://github.com/Spiratatoe/CEC-2024-Programming-Competition/blob/main/interface/pygame_cec.py) file in Python.

## To run development code
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) Version: 3.11.7 
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) Version: 3.8.3
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Version: 2.2.1
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) Version 1.26.4
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) Version 0.13.2

**To have a better visualization of the graph, we highly suggest you install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Version: 24.1.2 to run [Spyder](https://www.spyder.com/) Version 5.4.3.**

The simple way to look at our results would be to open [rig1_data.csv](https://github.com/Spiratatoe/CEC-2024-Programming-Competition/blob/main/rig1_data.csv) and [rig2_data.csv](https://github.com/Spiratatoe/CEC-2024-Programming-Competition/blob/main/rig2_data.csv) files.

## Data files we are using are found inside the [data](https://github.com/Spiratatoe/CEC-2024-Programming-Competition/tree/main/data) folder
- Helium (helium_data_day_1.csv to helium_data_day_30.csv)
- Coral Reefs (coral_data_day_1.csv to coral_data_day_30.csv)
- Endangered Species (species_data_day_1.csv to species_data_day_30.csv)

**We are using a total of 90 files.**
